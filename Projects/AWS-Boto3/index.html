        <div class="content">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my learning of AWS, I decided that I would learn by doing. AWS offers a service called Boto3, which is a python api that is essentially a wrapper for the AWS CLI. Which means that if you have the CLI installed and configured properly, you can just execute the scripts and they happen. This makes devops more secure and easy, privacy keys are shared around less and its a quick configuration. This also allows code to be shared and used by others because of its secure out of the box setup. So I decided to show my journey in learning AWS bur primarily the module Boto3. Boto3 is a lengthy module, and an amazing tool to devops in the cloud. <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html">Here</a> is a link to its documentation. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intentionally set it up so that it could be run as a module. You could call it from other files and use it to automate your devops. If you would like to use it in your code, please do so <a href="https://github.com/coulterminer/AWSBoto3">here!</a> or just clone repository <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>gh repo clone coulterminer/AWSBoto3</code></p></p>
